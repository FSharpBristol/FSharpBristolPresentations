# F# Bristol Presentations

Presentations for [F# |> Bristol](https://www.meetup.com/FSharpBristol/) using [FsReveal](https://github.com/fsprojects/FsReveal)

The presentations themselves can be found in the "slides" folder.  

To build them run `build.cmd` or `build.sh`.

The output, which can be published as a stand-alone static website, can be found in the "output" folder

(Note, I believe the output folder has some extra Bower/Grunt dependencies you need to run first to make it turly static)
